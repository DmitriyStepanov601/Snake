# Snake

This application is an interpretation of the famous game Snake, the essence of which is to collect all the fruits located on the field.
The snake starts its movement from the middle of the field, its movement can be controlled using the keys that are presented on the right panel of the application.
The player controls a long, slender snake-like creature that crawls along a plane (bounded by walls), collecting food, avoiding colliding with its own tail and 
the edges of the playing field.

Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it becomes longer, which gradually complicates the game. The player controls the direction of movement of the 
snake's head (usually 4 directions: up, down, left, right), and the snake's tail moves after it. The player cannot stop the snake's movement.
